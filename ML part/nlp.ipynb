The language was first released in 1995 when there were few options for building dynamic websites.\\r\\nwebsite website \\r\\nASP.NET is Microsoftâ\\x80\\x99s answer to Sun Microsystemâ\\x80\\x99s (now, Oracle) Java. The web application framework is used to build websites using languages like Visual Basic (VB), C#, F#, and more.\\r\\n\\r\\nIts MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern allows backend development duties to be handled by a controller, which interacts with a model to process data. The result is then presented to the view for display as a frontend web page.\\r\\nRuby on Rails (or Ruby) is a web development language built on top of the Ruby programming language. Ruby on Rails has a set of tools that allow you to simply create basic tasks (e.g. youâ\\x80\\x99re able to create a basic blog with one line of code).\\r\\n\\r\\nRuby involves little backend work, enabling developers to create and launch applications quickly. It is similar to Python in that itâ\\x80\\x99s fantastic for prototyping. Ruby grew in popularity in the early 2000s as a result but has declined since then.\\r\\nwebsite web websites\\r\\nNot to be confused with Java, JavaScript is a language that can be used for both the front end and back end.\\r\\n\\r\\nItâ\\x80\\x99s a great language for beginners because it is a higher-level language and there is little setup involved (you can start coding in your browser).\\r\\nAs you would probably already be aware, in a typical client-server architecture, application data is stored in the server-side and served as output to the client-side. The server-side working of a web application is known as backend.

       "  '\\r\\nBlockchain is a specific type of database.\\r\\nIt differs from a typical database in the way it stores information; blockchains store data in blocks that are then chained together. \\r\\nAs new data comes in it is entered into a fresh block. Once the block is filled with data it is chained onto the previous block, which makes the data chained together in chronological order.\\r\\nDifferent types of information can be stored on a blockchain but the most common use so far has been as a ledger for transactions. \\r\\nIn Bitcoinâ\\x80\\x99s case, blockchain is used in a decentralized way so that no single person or group has controlâ\\x80\\x94rather, all users collectively retain control.\\r\\nDecentralized blockchains are immutable, which means that the data entered is irreversible. For Bitcoin, this means that transactions are permanently recorded and viewable to anyone.\\r\\nDapps dapps smart contract\\r\\nBlockchain seems complicated, and it definitely can be, but its core concept is really quite simple. A blockchain is a type of database. To be able to understand blockchain, it helps to first understand what a database actually is.  \\r\\netherium\\r\\nBecause of the decentralized nature of Bitcoinâ\\x80\\x99s blockchain, all transactions can be transparently viewed by either having a personal node or by using blockchain explorers that allow anyone to see transactions occurring live. \\r\\nEach node has its own copy of the chain that gets updated as fresh blocks are confirmed and added. \\r\\nThis means that if you wanted to, you could track Bitcoin wherever it goes.  \\r\\nBlockchain technology accounts for the issues of security and trust in several ways. First, new blocks are always stored linearly and chronologically. \\r\\nThat is, they are always added to the â\\x80\\x9cendâ\\x80\\x9d of the blockchain. If you take a look at Bitcoinâ\\x80\\x99s blockchain, youâ\\x80\\x99ll see that each block has a position on the chain, called a â\\x80\\x9cheight.â\\x80\\x9d \\r\\nAs of November 2020, the blockâ\\x80\\x99s height had reached 656,197 blocks so far.  \\r\\nBlockchain forms the bedrock for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. The U.S. dollar is controlled by the Federal Reserve. Under this central authority system, a userâ\\x80\\x99s data and currency are technically at the whim of their bank or government. If a userâ\\x80\\x99s bank is hacked, the clientâ\\x80\\x99s private information is at risk\\r\\nUsing cryptocurrency wallets for savings accounts or as a means of payment is especially profound for those who have no state identification. Some countries may be war-torn or have governments that lack any real infrastructure to provide identification. Citizens of such countries may not have access to savings or brokerage accounts and therefore, no way to safely store wealth. \\r\\nA smart contract is a computer code that can be built into the blockchain to facilitate, verify, or negotiate a contract agreement. Smart contracts operate under a set of conditions that users agree to. When those conditions are met, the terms of the agreement are automatically carried out. \\r\\nAs mentioned, blockchain could be used to facilitate a modern voting system. Voting with blockchain carries the potential to eliminate election fraud and boost voter turnout, as was tested in the November 2018 midterm elections in West Virginia.Using blockchain in this way would make votes nearly impossible to tamper with',\n",

In order to run machine learning algorithms we need to convert the text files into numerical feature vectors.\\r\\n We will be using bag of words model for our example. Briefly, we segment each text file into words (for English splitting by space), and count # of times each \\r\\nword occurs in each document and finally assign each word an integer id. Each unique word in our dictionary will correspond to a feature (descriptive feature).\\r\\nhere are various algorithms which can be used for text classification. We will start with the most simplest one â\\x80\\x98Naive Bayes \\r\\n\\r\\nYou can easily build a NBclassifier in scikit using below 2 lines of code.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dataset used in this article is the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset taken from the UCI repository.\\r\\nThe code for this article can be found here.\\r\\nThe code is implemented in Python and different classification models are applied.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this article I will be using the following classification models for classification :\\r\\n\\r\\nSVM\\r\\nNaive Bayes\\r\\nLogistic Regression\\r\\nDecision Tree\\r\\nRandom Forest\\r\\nLightGBM\\r\\nXGboost\\r\\n\\r\\nMachine Learning\\r\\n\\r\\nMachine learning is an emerging subdivision of artificial intelligence. Its primary focus is to design systems, allow them to learn and make predictions based on the experience. It trains machine learning algorithms using a training dataset to create a model.\\r\\nThe model uses the new input data to predict heart disease. Using machine learning, it detects hidden patterns in the input dataset to build models. It makes accurate predictions for new datasets. The dataset is cleaned and missing values are filled. The model uses the new input data to predict heart disease and then tested for accuracy. \\r\\nMachine learning techniques are classified as:\\r\\nSupervised Learning\\r\\n\\r\\nThe model is trained on a dataset that is labelled. It has input data and its outcomes. Data are classified and split into training and test dataset. Training dataset trains our model while testing dataset functions as new data to get accuracy of the model. The dataset exists with models and its output. The classification and regression are its example.\\r\\nUnsupervised Learning\\r\\n\\r\\nData used to train are not classified or labelled in the dataset. Aim is to find hidden patterns in the data. The model is trained to develop patterns. It can easily predict hidden patterns for any new input dataset, but upon exploring data, it draws conclusion from datasets to describe hidden patterns. \\r\\nIn this technique, no responses in the dataset are seen. The clustering method is an example of an unsupervised learning technique.\\r\\nReinforcement Learning\\r\\n\\r\\nIt does not use labelled dataset nor the results are associated with data, thus model learns from the experience. In this technique, the model improves its presentation based on its association with environment and figures out how to discuss its faults and to get the right outcome through assessment and testing various prospects.\\r\\n\\r\\nClassification algorithms are commonly used supervised learning techniques to define probability of heart disease occurrence.\\r\\nClassification Machine Learning Techniques\\r\\n\\r\\nThe classification task is used for prediction of subsequent cases dependent on past information. Many data mining techniques as NaÃ¯ve Bayes, neural network, decision tree have been applied by researchers to have a precision diagnosis in heart disease.\\r\\nThe accuracy given by different techniques varies with number of attributes.\\r\\nThis research provides diagnostic accuracy score for improvement of better health results. \\r\\nWe have used WEKA tool in this research for pre-processing the dataset, which is in ARFF format (attribute-relation file format). Only 14 attributes of all 76 different attributes have been considered for analysis to get precise results.\\r\\nBy comparison and analysis using different algorithms with WEKA tool heart disease can be predicted and treated early and prompt.',\n",
       "  'Platform as a service refers to cloud computing services that supply an on-demand environment for developing, testing, delivering and managing software applications. PaaS is designed to make it easier for developers to quickly create web or mobile apps, without worrying about setting up or managing the underlying infrastructure of servers, storage, network and databases needed for development.\\r\\nServerless computing\\r\\n\\r\\nOverlapping with PaaS, serverless computing focuses on building app functionality without spending time continually managing the servers and infrastructure required to do so. The cloud provider handles the setup, capacity planning and server management for you. Serverless architectures are highly scalable and event-driven, only using resources when a specific function or trigger occurs.\\r\\nSoftware as a service (SaaS)\\r\\n\\r\\nSoftware as a service is a method for delivering software applications over the Internet, on demand and typically on a subscription basis. With SaaS, cloud providers host and manage the software application and underlying infrastructure and handle any maintenance, like software upgrades and security patching. Users connect to the application over the Internet, usually with a web browser on their phone, tablet or PC.\\r\\nOrganizations of every type, size, and industry are using the cloud for a wide variety of use cases, such as data backup, disaster recovery, email, virtual desktops, software development and testing, big data analytics, and customer-facing web applications. For example, healthcare companies are using the cloud to develop more personalized treatments for patients. Financial services companies are using the cloud to power real-time fraud detection and prevention. And video game makers are using the cloud to deliver online games to millions of players around the world. \\r\\n',\n",
       "  'The paper presents an efficient cloud resource provisioning approach. The Software as a Service (SaaS) provider leases resources from cloud providers and also leases software as services to SaaS users. The SaaS providers aim at minimizing the payment of using VMs from cloud providers, and want to maximize the profit earned through serving the SaaS usersâ\\x80\\x99 requests. The SaaS providers also guarantee meeting quality of service (QoS)\\r\\nrequirements of the SaaS users. The cloud provider is to maximize the profit without exceeding the upper bound of energy consumption of cloud provider for provisioning virtual machines (VMs) to the SaaS provider. The SaaS users purpose to obtain the optimized QoS to accomplish their jobs with a limited budget and deadline. The proposed optimal cloud resource provisioning algorithm includes two sub-algorithms at different levels:\\r\\ninteraction between the SaaS user and SaaS provider at the application layer and interaction between the SaaS provider and cloud resource provider at the resource layer. Simulations are conducted to compare the performance of proposed cloud resource provisioning algorithm with related work.\\r\\nCloud computing refers to both the applications delivered as services over the Internet and the hardware and systems software in the datacenters that provide those services [1, 2]. Cloud computing is characterized as making services available on demand [3]. Cloud computing delivers infrastructure, platform, and software (applications) as services, \\r\\nwhich are made available to consumers as subscription-based services under the pay-as-you-go model. In industry these services are referred to as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS), respectively .\\r\\nCloud management is responsible for all resources used by all the applications deployed in the cloud. Clouds depend on virtualization of resources to provide management combined with separation of users.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome cloud computing providers employ the utility computing model, which is analogous to how traditional utility services (such as electricity) are consumed, whereas others bill on a subscription basis. In Amazon EC2, users pay on the basis of number of type of instances they use, where an instance is characterized on basis of parameters like CPU cores, memory, and disk capacity [5, 6]. With a Pay-per-Use model,\\r\\ncloud resource provisioning is taken to satisfy the SaaS userâ\\x80\\x99s needs with reducing cost while maximizing the profit of the SaaS provider. Reducing energy consumption is also important for cloud resource providers to decrease operating costs and maximize the revenue of cloud provider [7, 8, 25]. Therefore, how to serve request of the SaaS user to meet Quality of Service (QoS) needs and maximize the profit of the SaaS provider and cloud resource provider becomes an urgent problem to be solved in cloud computing environment.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe paper presents an efficient cloud resource provisioning approach, which is beneficial for the SaaS users, SaaS provider and cloud resource provider. The SaaS provider leases resources from cloud providers and also leases software as services to the SaaS users.

Simulations are conducted to compare the performance of proposed cloud resource provisioning algorithm with related work.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rest of the paper is structured as followings. Section 2 discusses the related works. Section 3 presents optimal resources provisioning in cloud computing environment which includes the optimization for interaction between the SaaS provider and cloud resource provider, and the optimization for interaction between the SaaS user and SaaS provider. Section 4 describes optimal resources provisioning algorithm in cloud computing. \\r\\nIn Sect. 5 the experiments and analysis are conducted and discussed.

The language was first released in 1995 when there were few options for building dynamic websites.\\r\\nwebsite website \\r\\nASP.NET is Microsoftâ\\x80\\x99s answer to Sun Microsystemâ\\x80\\x99s (now, Oracle) Java. The web application framework is used to build websites using languages like Visual Basic (VB), C#, F#, and more.\\r\\n\\r\\nIts MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern allows backend development duties to be handled by a controller, which interacts with a model to process data. The result is then presented to the view for display as a frontend web page.\\r\\nRuby on Rails (or Ruby) is a web development language built on top of the Ruby programming language. Ruby on Rails has a set of tools that allow you to simply create basic tasks (e.g. youâ\\x80\\x99re able to create a basic blog with one line of code).\\r\\n\\r\\nRuby involves little backend work, enabling developers to create and launch applications quickly. It is similar to Python in that itâ\\x80\\x99s fantastic for prototyping. Ruby grew in popularity in the early 2000s as a result but has declined since then.\\r\\nwebsite web websites\\r\\nNot to be confused with Java, JavaScript is a language that can be used for both the front end and back end.\\r\\n\\r\\nItâ\\x80\\x99s a great language for beginners because it is a higher-level language and there is little setup involved (you can start coding in your browser).\\r\\nAs you would probably already be aware, in a typical client-server architecture, application data is stored in the server-side and served as output to the client-side. The server-side working of a web application is known as backend.

       "  '\\r\\nBlockchain is a specific type of database.\\r\\nIt differs from a typical database in the way it stores information; blockchains store data in blocks that are then chained together. \\r\\nAs new data comes in it is entered into a fresh block. Once the block is filled with data it is chained onto the previous block, which makes the data chained together in chronological order.\\r\\nDifferent types of information can be stored on a blockchain but the most common use so far has been as a ledger for transactions. \\r\\nIn Bitcoinâ\\x80\\x99s case, blockchain is used in a decentralized way so that no single person or group has controlâ\\x80\\x94rather, all users collectively retain control.\\r\\nDecentralized blockchains are immutable, which means that the data entered is irreversible. For Bitcoin, this means that transactions are permanently recorded and viewable to anyone.\\r\\nDapps dapps smart contract\\r\\nBlockchain seems complicated, and it definitely can be, but its core concept is really quite simple. A blockchain is a type of database. To be able to understand blockchain, it helps to first understand what a database actually is.  \\r\\netherium\\r\\nBecause of the decentralized nature of Bitcoinâ\\x80\\x99s blockchain, all transactions can be transparently viewed by either having a personal node or by using blockchain explorers that allow anyone to see transactions occurring live. \\r\\nEach node has its own copy of the chain that gets updated as fresh blocks are confirmed and added. \\r\\nThis means that if you wanted to, you could track Bitcoin wherever it goes.  \\r\\nBlockchain technology accounts for the issues of security and trust in several ways. First, new blocks are always stored linearly and chronologically. \\r\\nThat is, they are always added to the â\\x80\\x9cendâ\\x80\\x9d of the blockchain. If you take a look at Bitcoinâ\\x80\\x99s blockchain, youâ\\x80\\x99ll see that each block has a position on the chain, called a â\\x80\\x9cheight.â\\x80\\x9d \\r\\nAs of November 2020, the blockâ\\x80\\x99s height had reached 656,197 blocks so far.  \\r\\nBlockchain forms the bedrock for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. The U.S. dollar is controlled by the Federal Reserve. Under this central authority system, a userâ\\x80\\x99s data and currency are technically at the whim of their bank or government. If a userâ\\x80\\x99s bank is hacked, the clientâ\\x80\\x99s private information is at risk\\r\\nUsing cryptocurrency wallets for savings accounts or as a means of payment is especially profound for those who have no state identification. Some countries may be war-torn or have governments that lack any real infrastructure to provide identification. Citizens of such countries may not have access to savings or brokerage accounts and therefore, no way to safely store wealth. \\r\\nA smart contract is a computer code that can be built into the blockchain to facilitate, verify, or negotiate a contract agreement. Smart contracts operate under a set of conditions that users agree to. When those conditions are met, the terms of the agreement are automatically carried out. \\r\\nAs mentioned, blockchain could be used to facilitate a modern voting system. Voting with blockchain carries the potential to eliminate election fraud and boost voter turnout, as was tested in the November 2018 midterm elections in West Virginia.Using blockchain in this way would make votes nearly impossible to tamper with',\n",

The classification and regression are its example.\\r\\nUnsupervised Learning\\r\\n\\r\\nData used to train are not classified or labelled in the dataset. Aim is to find hidden patterns in the data. The model is trained to develop patterns. It can easily predict hidden patterns for any new input dataset, but upon exploring data, it draws conclusion from datasets to describe hidden patterns. \\r\\nIn this technique, no responses in the dataset are seen. The clustering method is an example of an unsupervised learning technique.\\r\\nReinforcement Learning\\r\\n\\r\\nIt does not use labelled dataset nor the results are associated with data, thus model learns from the experience. In this technique, the model improves its presentation based on its association with environment and figures out how to discuss its faults and to get the right outcome through assessment and testing various prospects.\\r\\n\\r\\nClassification algorithms are commonly used supervised learning techniques to define probability of heart disease occurrence.\\r\\nClassification Machine Learning Techniques\\r\\n\\r\\nThe classification task is used for prediction of subsequent cases dependent on past information. Many data mining techniques as NaÃ¯ve Bayes, neural network, decision tree have been applied by researchers to have a precision diagnosis in heart disease.\\r\\nThe accuracy given by different techniques varies with number of attributes.\\r\\nThis research provides diagnostic accuracy score for improvement of better health results. \\r\\nWe have used WEKA tool in this research for pre-processing the dataset, which is in ARFF format (attribute-relation file format). Only 14 attributes of all 76 different attributes have been considered for analysis to get precise results.\\r\\nBy comparison and analysis using different algorithms with WEKA tool heart disease can be predicted and treated early and prompt.',\n",
       "  'Platform as a service refers to cloud computing services that supply an on-demand environment for developing, testing, delivering and managing software applications. PaaS is designed to make it easier for developers to quickly create web or mobile apps, without worrying about setting up or managing the underlying infrastructure of servers, storage, network and databases needed for development.\\r\\nServerless computing\\r\\n\\r\\nOverlapping with PaaS, serverless computing focuses on building app functionality without spending time continually managing the servers and infrastructure required to do so. The cloud provider handles the setup, capacity planning and server management for you. Serverless architectures are highly scalable and event-driven, only using resources when a specific function or trigger occurs.\\r\\nSoftware as a service (SaaS)\\r\\n\\r\\nSoftware as a service is a method for delivering software applications over the Internet, on demand and typically on a subscription basis. With SaaS, cloud providers host and manage the software application and underlying infrastructure and handle any maintenance, like software upgrades and security patching. Users connect to the application over the Internet, usually with a web browser on their phone, tablet or PC.\\r\\nOrganizations of every type, size, and industry are using the cloud for a wide variety of use cases, such as data backup, disaster recovery, email, virtual desktops, software development and testing, big data analytics, and customer-facing web applications. For example, healthcare companies are using the cloud to develop more personalized treatments for patients. Financial services companies are using the cloud to power real-time fraud detection and prevention. And video game makers are using the cloud to deliver online games to millions of players around the world. \\r\\n',\n",
       "  'The paper presents an efficient cloud resource provisioning approach. The Software as a Service (SaaS) provider leases resources from cloud providers and also leases software as services to SaaS users. The SaaS providers aim at minimizing the payment of using VMs from cloud providers, and want to maximize the profit earned through serving the SaaS usersâ\\x80\\x99 requests. The SaaS providers also guarantee meeting quality of service (QoS)\\r\\nrequirements of the SaaS users. The cloud provider is to maximize the profit without exceeding the upper bound of energy consumption of cloud provider for provisioning virtual machines (VMs) to the SaaS provider. The SaaS users purpose to obtain the optimized QoS to accomplish their jobs with a limited budget and deadline. The proposed optimal cloud resource provisioning algorithm includes two sub-algorithms at different levels:\\r\\ninteraction between the SaaS user and SaaS provider at the application layer and interaction between the SaaS provider and cloud resource provider at the resource layer. Simulations are conducted to compare the performance of proposed cloud resource provisioning algorithm with related work.\\r\\nCloud computing refers to both the applications delivered as services over the Internet and the hardware and systems software in the datacenters that provide those services [1, 2]. Cloud computing is characterized as making services available on demand [3]. Cloud computing delivers infrastructure, platform, and software (applications) as services, \\r\\nwhich are made available to consumers as subscription-based services under the pay-as-you-go model. In industry these services are referred to as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS), respectively .\\r\\nCloud management is responsible for all resources used by all the applications deployed in the cloud. Clouds depend on virtualization of resources to provide management combined with separation of users.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome cloud computing providers employ the utility computing model, which is analogous to how traditional utility services (such as electricity) are consumed, whereas others bill on a subscription basis. In Amazon EC2, users pay on the basis of number of type of instances they use, where an instance is characterized on basis of parameters like CPU cores, memory, and disk capacity [5, 6]. With a Pay-per-Use model,\\r\\ncloud resource provisioning is taken to satisfy the SaaS userâ\\x80\\x99s needs with reducing cost while maximizing the profit of the SaaS provider. Reducing energy consumption is also important for cloud resource providers to decrease operating costs and maximize the revenue of cloud provider [7, 8, 25]. Therefore, how to serve request of the SaaS user to meet Quality of Service (QoS) needs and maximize the profit of the SaaS provider and cloud resource provider becomes an urgent problem to be solved in cloud computing environment.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe paper presents an efficient cloud resource provisioning approach, which is beneficial for the SaaS users, SaaS provider and cloud resource provider. The SaaS provider leases resources from cloud providers and also leases software as services to the SaaS users. The SaaS providers aim at minimizing the payment of using Virtual Machines (VMs) from cloud providers, and want to maximize the profit earned through serving the SaaS usersâ\\x80\\x99 requests. The SaaS providers also guarantee meeting QoS requirement of the SaaS users.\\r\\nThe cloud provider is to maximize the profit without exceeding the upper bound of energy consumption of cloud provider for provisioning VMs to the SaaS provider.

Simulations are conducted to compare the performance of proposed cloud resource provisioning algorithm with related work.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rest of the paper is structured as followings. Section 2 discusses the related works. Section 3 presents optimal resources provisioning in cloud computing environment which includes the optimization for interaction between the SaaS provider and cloud resource provider, and the optimization for interaction between the SaaS user and SaaS provider. Section 4 describes optimal resources provisioning algorithm in cloud computing. \\r\\nIn Sect. 5 the experiments and analysis are conducted and discussed. In Sect. 6, an application example is given. Section 7 gives the conclusions to the paper.'],\n",
