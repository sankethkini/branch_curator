You node have a file of transactions on your computer ledger Two government accountants (let's call them miners have the same file on theirs so it’s distributed As you make a transaction, your computer sends an e-mail to each accountant to inform them.

Each accountant rushes to be the first to check whether you can afford it and be paid their salary Bitcoins The first to check and validate hits “REPLY ALL”, attaching their logic for verifying the transaction proof of work

This concept is enabled by "Blockchain" technology
Blockchain is a system of recording information in a way that makes it difficult or impossible to change, hack, or cheat the system.

A blockchain is essentially a digital ledger of transactions that is duplicated and distributed across the entire network of computer systems on the blockchain. Each block in the chain contains a number of transactions, and every time a new transaction occurs on the blockchain,
a record of that transaction is added to every participant’s ledger. The decentralised database managed by multiple participants is known as Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)
