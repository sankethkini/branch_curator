Applications that use blockchain are called dApps (Decentralised Applications). Looking around today, weâ€™ll mostly find decentralized apps in fintech, but blockchain goes beyond decentralized finance. We have health platforms, music streaming/sharing platforms, e-commerce platforms, cybersecurity platforms, and IOTs moving towards decentralized applications (dApps) as cited above.

So, when would it make sense to consider using blockchain for our applications, rather than a standard database or record?
